# Aquatics-Hiring-Assessment
The aquatics hiring assessment project is designed to upgrade the University at Buffalo's Aquatics Department current lifeguard hiring assessment from all paper to online.
In addition to making the assessment digital, the project's secondary goal is to create a website for both patrons of the pool and employees for information, COVID-19 updates, and scheduling purposes.
The project is currently in the works, but when complete, employees are expected to be able to visit the website and have everything they need in one page! <br />
## Website
Because the website is currently being deployed by heroku, you must type ubaquatics.herokuapp.com to visit. Do not include the following:
